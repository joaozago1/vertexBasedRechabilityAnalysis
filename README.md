# vertexBasedRechabilityAnalysis
Repository containing implementation of the algorithms presented on: Vertex-based reachability analysis for verifying ReLU deep neural networks [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12001">1</a>].

## Installation

The download of this library can be done as follows:

```
(@v1.6) pkg> add https://github.com/joaozago1/vertexBasedRechabilityAnalysis
```

The implementation runs in Julia 1.6.

It is important that the dependencies are satisfied so that the code works correctly.

## Examples

We provided a simple toy example on example/ folder to guide the first steps on the application of the reachability algorithms. This examples is presented both as a script and as a jupyter notebook.

## References

Follows the reference with a formal presentation of the work implemented here.
